Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, consisting of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node points to null.

Operations
Insertion
Insert at Beginning: Add a new node at the beginning of the list.
Insert at End: Append a new node at the end of the list.
Insert at Position: Insert a new node at a specified position in the list.
Deletion
Delete from Beginning: Remove the first node from the list.
Delete from End: Remove the last node from the list.
Delete by Value: Remove a node with a given value from the list.
Traversal
Forward Traversal: Traverse the list from the head to the end.
Reverse Traversal: Traverse the list from the end to the head (if a tail pointer is maintained).
Other Operations
Search: Find a node with a specific value in the list.
Get Length: Count the number of nodes in the list.
Advantages
Dynamic Size: Singly linked lists can grow or shrink in size during execution.
Efficient Insertion/Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations can be performed efficiently with O(1) complexity at the beginning of the list, given a reference to the head node.
Simple Implementation: Singly linked lists are relatively simple to implement compared to other data structures like arrays or trees.
Limitations
No Random Access: Accessing elements by index requires traversing the list from the beginning, resulting in O(n) complexity.
Extra Space for Pointers: Each node in a singly linked list requires extra space to store a reference to the next node, which can increase memory overhead.
Memory Fragmentation: Memory for nodes is allocated dynamically, which can lead to memory fragmentation issues.
Applications
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Singly linked lists are commonly used in memory allocation schemes like malloc() in C.
Stacks and Queues: Linked lists are the basis for implementing stack and queue data structures.
Graph Algorithms: Linked lists are used in graph algorithms like adjacency lists to represent graphs.
